## A / B Testing AngularJS

You have goals that you want your visitors to accomplish (e.g., make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter) or metrics you want to improve (e.g., revenue, visit duration, bounce rate). A/B testing lets you test which version leads to the greatest improvement. 

##### Testing Patterns

* Headline
* Image
* Call to action
* Layout

This is something I haven't done in AngularJS yet, so I'm looking for community input on what works well. My current thought is to leverage existing tools such as the Google Analytics [Experiments API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/platform/features/experiments-overview).

### What is working well for you?
